    <h1>This is a visible heading</h1>

    <p>Notice that the hidden heading still takes up space.</p>

    <h2>CSS Max-width</h2>
    <div class="ex1">This div element has width: 500px;</div>
    <br />
    <div class="ex2">This div element has max-width: 500px;</div>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide,
      to see the difference between the two divs!
    </p>

    <h2>position: static;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it
      is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
    </p>
    <div class="static">This div element has position: static;</div>

    <h2>position: relative;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal
      position:
    </p>
    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;</div>

    <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
      which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is
      scrolled:
    </p>
    <div class="fixed">This div element has position: fixed;</div>
    <br />
    <img src="tree.jpeg" alt="A Tree" />
    <p>
      Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.
    </p>
    <div class="overflow-container">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>
